# Multi-Threading-Project

1) Implement a Counter Class using Multithreading using Synchronization block.
   
2)	Use a static Counter variable. This variable counts the number of child thread created.
   
3)	Use a final maxNumOfChildThreads variable. This variable counts the max number of child threads
   
4)	Main program (ThreadHandlingMain.java) should create multiple child thread process (IncrementThread.java) based on maxNumOfChildThreads variable.
   
5)	IncrementThread.java should use the Counter variable to increment for each child process created.

6)	Main program should not exit until all the child threads completes. Use wait and join methods in thread.
